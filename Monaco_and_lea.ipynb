    "Implementing Monaco examples in Lea\n",
    "===================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monaco program uses Monte Carlo simulation to calculate probability distributions for games. It uses its own custom language for defining the probability to be simulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monaco offers both simulation-based results and (for sufficiently simple cases) exact calculation of probabilities. It is coded in C++ for speed, and has a wealth of outputoptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python library [lea](https://bitbucket.org/piedenis/lea) implements discrete probability distributions in Python. It calculates exact distributions based on calculations built up from primitive distribution objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Examples\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monaco documentation comes with a number of example calculations, ranging from very simple (rolling dice to generate D&D characters) to extremely complex (a simulation of Cribbage). In this notebook, we are going to attempt to reproduce the Monaco examples using Lea, as an exercise to compare the power of the two tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer** The Monaco program has been developed over an extensive period and is written specifically for the task in hand in a compiled language. On the other hand, I have had little or no prior experience with lea, and the code runs in interpreted Python. Furthermore, apart from the Monaco \"exact\" mode, the two programs produce their results in completely different ways. While I will be looking at performance of the various calculations, this is simply for interest and not in any way a comparison of the two programs."

    "We're also going to want to work out how long it takes to get our results. This is for two main reasons. First, as a bit of amusement to see how well our code compares with Monaco. As noted above, Monaco is customised for this task, and has a lot of options that we're not even looking at here, so \"which approach is faster\" comparisons are somewhat pointless. But I find it interesting to know how competitive my \"use a high-level language and find a library that's already written to do the hard stuff\" approach is in practice. And secondly, the naive approach to some of the following problems scales *really* badly, so we'll time our code to get an idea of when things start to go bad and we need to do some optimisation."

    "Internally, lea uses various different object types for probability distributions. The `Alea` type is the fundamental \"results with weights\" type, and as such, is fast to use. The `Clea` type is the other one we've been using so far. It represents a cartesian join of distributions, but it doesn't actually calculate any results until needed (at which point it does the calculations and caches the result, which is why the time spent in our examples so far is when we display the results).\n",
    "\n",
    "The above function uses a new type, `Blea`, which represents a conditional probability. So `Lea.if_(cond, t, f)` builds a structure that chooses `t` or `f` depending on the value of `cond`. We use this to define an object that only includes the 3rd, 4th and subsequent dice if needed. (The code as given then forces the evaluation of the probabilities by explicitly requesting an `Alea` object at the end, but if it didn't, the usual \"evaluate on demand\" would occur).\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding in the \"Gaol\" result is harder to do than it looks. The problem is that we are adding 0 to the sum (rather than a further recursive segment of the expression tree) to terminate the recursion on a non-equal pair, but when we hit the maximum number of rerolls, there's no easy way to push an \"exceptional\" result back up to the top level. It can be done, but the implementation is tricky. Basically you have to add control-flow into a purely expression-based calculation. Functional programmers are probably wondering what the fuss is all about, but from an imperative perspective, it's hard to get your mind round the necessary contortions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a working implementation, but it's hard to love it. I'm using an anonymous function (lambda) and immediately calling it, to simulate the use of temporary variables in an expression. There are certainly better ways of doing this. But we'll leave this topic for now, as the principle is established, and we'll likely come back to it later, for more complex problems."

A sorted result is certainly one of the \"unique up to ordering\" answers, and for some problems having the results sorted might be useful (it would have helped in the D&D example above, for instance).
